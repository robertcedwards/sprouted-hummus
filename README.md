Sprouted Chickpea Hummus Recipe 🌱
Ingredients:
1 cup sprouted chickpeas (see notes on sprouting below) 🌾
3-4 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 large lemon) 🍋
1/4 cup tahini (sesame paste) 🥄
1 large garlic clove, minced 🧄
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste 🧂
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
2-3 tablespoons ice water 💧
Olive oil, for drizzling 🫒
Paprika or sumac, for garnish 🌶️
Fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish) 🌿
Instructions:
1. Sprout the Chickpeas:
Soak dry chickpeas in water overnight. Drain and rinse, then place in a sprouting jar or a colander covered with a cloth. Rinse several times a day until they sprout (1-3 days).
2. Cook the Chickpeas in the Instant Pot:
Rinse the sprouted chickpeas well and transfer to the Instant Pot. Add water to cover by about 2 inches.
Secure the lid, set the valve to sealing, and cook on high pressure for 20 minutes.
Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then manually release any remaining pressure.
3. Peel the Chickpeas:
When cool enough to handle, gently peel each chickpea to remove the skin for a smoother texture.
4. Blend the Ingredients:
In a food processor, combine the peeled chickpeas, lemon juice, tahini, garlic, salt, and cumin. Blend until smooth.
5. Add Ice Water:
While blending, slowly add ice water to achieve a creamy consistency.
6. Taste and Adjust:
Adjust seasoning with more salt, lemon juice, or cumin as needed.
7. Serve:
Transfer to a serving bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with paprika or sumac. Garnish with chopped parsley if desired.
8. Enjoy:
Serve with warm pita bread, vegetable sticks, or as part of a meal.
Notes:
Sprouting: Enhances nutritional value and digestibility.
Peeling: Optional but recommended for creaminess.
Instant Pot: Reduces cooking time and preserves nutrients.
Enjoy your delicious and nutritious sprouted chickpea hummus! 😊
